A website site that markets the Tablespoon brand. This website is a responsive and is run by Sitecore.

What I did:

* Implement a global navigation component that is driven through Sitecore.
* This navigation component must work on other core sites.
* This component must be responsive.
* The different sites have different animations. For example, how the menu opens and closes.
* The links in the navigation changed often through Sitecore. For example, one day there might be a link for "Best Recipes" and another day it could be removed or replaced.
* The business also re-branded the website so I updated all colors, logos, fonts, etc
