# Creating Modular Frameworks

What is a modular framework?

A modular framework are made of components that can "live" alone or with other components. 

Popular Examples:

* Lightening UI
* Bootstrap

Many companies opt to create their own modular framework because they find UI frameworks to be too cumbersome and can not be easily extended. Basically, the company picks a framework and find that they need special components and/or designs. They start to override the framework code. Many companies end up with a framework that is a cross between the original framework and their own framework (with overrides and CSS craziness).
