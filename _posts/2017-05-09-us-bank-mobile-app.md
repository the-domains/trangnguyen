Projects:

* [Mobile & Tablet App][0]
* [Online Banking Website][1]

Us Bank website and native app share the same code. This is done using Cordova (Phonegap) to wrap HTML, JS, CSS and create native app experience. The project involved re-writing and re-branding the Us Bank App and Online Banking Experience

Team: User Experience
